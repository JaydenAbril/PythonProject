For our python quiz, we both had trouble making mostly the while loop function and the cash/money function. We both did our best trying to find out how to do these functions and we both figured out that we put the functions in the wrong order, so we switched and switched until the function was right, and soon enough, we figured it out and we got everything working. In the end, I thought this project was pretty fun, we both learned a lot from this project and we learned more about how the functions we had trouble on worked and more on while loops.
